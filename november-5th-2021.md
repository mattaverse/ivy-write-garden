      * Last week, [@nic__carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter) and @shaunenergy brought us some good news:

        - a politician got something right.
        - [@tedcruz]([[Ted Cruz]]) wants to use bitcoin mining to strengthen the Texas power grid.
        - At what cost to the environment?
        - Zero. Might be carbon negative.
        - 7 tweets [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) (saves 34 min)
      * 1/ How would mining BTC make the power grid stronger?

        - By being a reliable power-eater for weird energy sources.
        - BTC miners can operate anywhere, anytime, with variable load, and can be shut off instantly.
        - If a power supplier has no one to sell to, BTC will buy the excess.
      * 2/ If your energy source isn't cost effective b/c there's nobody to buy the power, put a BTC miner on it.

        - Now you're ALWAYS a profitable energy supplier in a weird/remote area.
        - If a storm hits and the locals need extra energy, you turn off the miner and sell them the energy.
      * 3/ Texas has more wind farms than any other state. So much that sometimes there's abundance, and power prices are negative.

        - Slap a BTC miner on it. You don't have to shut down the wind farm/operate at a loss when you make excess energy.
        - Now you can afford more wind farms.
      * 4/ More wind/solar farms means more green energy. The grid gets greener.

        - Since BTC miners won't operate at 100% all the time, their activity isn't just offset by their wind/solar sources, it's carbon negative.
        - And the grid gets bigger, denser, more available to real people.
      * 5/ But the wind doesn't always blow. Output falls, power prices spike.

        - Nat gas gets burned to meet demand.
        - West Texas does 50% of U.S. nat gas "flaring", per Cruz.
        - When you find a new gas source, you have to burn some for a while to eval how much gas you can get out of it.
      * 6/ Using it to mine BTC right away would prevent the waste AND give you more time to figure out if a full-blown plant/pipeline should get built there.

        - Less wasted emissions, less failed oil/gas projects, less wasted infrastructure to nowhere.
        - [twitter.com/APompliano/staâ€¦](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1446992449474285568?s=20)
      * 7/7 There has never been an energy-eater as mobile or flexible as BTC mining.

        - Demand can be adjusted or turned off instantly. Full power output can go straight to people in need, anytime.
        - New energy sources can be profitable in more places than ever before. Even green sources.

        - and follow @scribedao to save time (34 min with this one, congrats)
