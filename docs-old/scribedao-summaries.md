      * For [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO)
    + 2/ Network - collection of strongly connected relationships (neurons, internet, mycelium)

      * Impact Networks - networks that connect for specific purpose, learning
      * Key ingredients: purpose, principles, people, type of participation, trust, coordination, collab, infra, leadership
    + 3/ Infra - processes, tools and resources

      * Leaders take responsibility to shape direction &amp; work critical for self org networks &amp; seamless power distribution
      * Creates self org space with collab value, focus on onboarding, design, convo facilitation, collaborative structure
    + 4/ Leaders also look out for like minded, competent, suitable skill set endowed people who fit into these networks

      * Connections vs autocracy, good conflict resolution
      * Relationships balanced with quick wins, convening divergent thinking &amp; tensions
    + 5/ How do leaders handle these tensions well ?

      * Label common tension experiences to deal with them faster

    + 7/ Building trust in open collaborative environments is key

      * Ingredients of trust: openness, reliability, care,
      * a space for diverse opinions, friendly openness to emergent thinking,
      * direct connections with participants, creating retreats beyond work chatter
    + 8/ Anonymity in emergent impact networks: It's fine, active convenance beyond personal info through strong viewpoints, personality beyond id

      * 1 on 1 human connections are the basis of open collab communities, ownership is a critical factor, ability of community to shape direction
    + 9/Balance task oriented structure with relationship first community

      * Structure around task vs relationship first structure

    + 1/ Summary of [@chaserchapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman)‚Äôs interview with [@patrickxrivera](https://twitter.com/patrickxrivera) of [@viamirror](https://twitter.com/viamirror): Lifecycle of a web3 community

      * For [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO)
    + 2/ Mirror - platform dedicated towards writers, success from the growth of web3 communities

      * web 3 akin to a group chat with shared bank a/c &amp; capital flows
      * with tools for governance (snapshot), crowdfunding (mirror)
      * &amp; work groups towards specific areas (treasury, onboarding)
    + 3/ Role of a core team with full contributors vs part time ones ?

      * Depends on purpose or a focus on specific use cases, can be flexible for general purpose or casual DAOs, formal structures evolve from them
      * Becoming a contributor - easy, levelling up - challenge
    + 4/ How to filter contributors across DAOs

      * Through open collab, curated through filter of vision, competence and skill set, measuring engagement levels through tasks like community call attendance, participation and execution of major ones too
    + 5/ Web3 community is the platform

      * difference between web2 &amp; web3 is web3 has a unifying open standard to engage and empower communities through ownership
      * web3 apps built around community
      * Metrics to be kept in mind for building web3 comm focused apps: TBD
    + 6/ Lens to see communities: $AXS (Axie) view of communities as economies, subDAOs formed around sub cities, Inter crypto economy engagement

      * How to avoid crypto colonialism
      * In $AXS, it's the gatekeeper for user entry, entry cost increases as price goes up
    + 7/ A lot of gamers borrow from DeFi protocols to participate and make a living, high lending rates

      * DeFi protocols, whales dominate creating a divide &amp; preventing meaningful participation
      * solution: decrease entry costs, lending rate
    + 8/ How to build value led communities while preventing crypto colonialism:

      * Cites [@FWBtweets](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets), [@PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), [@FingerprintsDAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO), [@seedclubhq](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq)  as great role models for strong community first culture, great community management and friendly engagement with newcomers
    + 9/ Mono vs Poly DAO contribution:

      * Better to compound skillset working fully with one DAO, however explore DAOs by dividing time across these communities
    + 10/ Top patterns &amp; metrics of community lifecycle assessed across DAOs:

      * Onboarding: Token distribution, people selection, competence funnel &amp; work groups, discord structure &amp; engagement
      * Cites [@indexcoop](https://twitter.com/indexcoop)  onboarding as a rolemodel
      * Governance: forums for product governance,
    + 11/ Twitter engagement, ownership structure

      * Clear path for contribution, accountability and structure
      * Views on Governance
      * Crypto native social structure, engage rather than vote harvesting
      * Think from game mechanics view rather than archaic democracy lens

    + 1/9

      * This thread summarizes  [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin)'s "The creator attribution ratio".
      * TL;DR: #NFTs are about attribution and we still have a long way to go.
      * A [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) thread.
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 2/9

      * For him, the central function of NFTs is to attribute the value of digital contents to their creators and owners.
      * Current NFT designs are just stepping stones to better attribution of digital content.
      * Link: [The creator attribution ratio](https://creativekitchen.so/penguins/The-current-NFT-debate-is-a-false-choice-tIATu)
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 3/9

      * Many current NFTs aren't well connected to the value of the content they represent. Therefore, they won't retain their value long-term.
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 4/9

      * In an ideal scenario, whenever a digital content is used as input somewhere else, the NFT of that content should be attributed. If the output generate some monetary value, then some royalty should flow in to original input as well. [pic.twitter.com/pn63mqRANY](https://twitter.com/yahya_ahd/status/1456899245252956164/photo/1)
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 5/9

      * However, this isn't how current designs of NFTs work. Top Shot moment NFT doesn't get any royalties when the clip is used in some ad or movie.
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 6/9

      * Another weakness in attribution: value of an NFT is typically based on the value of the content at a given moment rather than total value it delivers over time. This creates volatility, which leads to "pump and dump" behaviors. [pic.twitter.com/Gpii8sp7A9](https://twitter.com/yahya_ahd/status/1456899279793098755/photo/1)
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 7/9

      * Attribution matters to creators of all kinds, ranging from scientists, writers, YouTubers etc. Creators rely on attribution in order to build a feedback loop from the content they build to further investment and advancement of their career.
    + [@Joey_DeBruin](https://twitter.com/Joey_DeBruin) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 8/9

      * Figuring out proper attribution mechanism will also help us in public goods funding.
      * The NFTs are clearly a step forward from the previous situation. However, we still have a long way to go to reach proper attribution.

    + üßµ Here's a summary thread on the latest hot topic ~ [@stablekwon](https://twitter.com/stablekwon) [@terra_money](https://twitter.com/terra_money)'s groundbreaking risk management protocol [@riskharbor](https://twitter.com/riskharbor)  that will safeguard the üåï üîí

      * [twitter.com/riskharbor/sta‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/riskharbor/status/1456296076458160137)
    + 1/10 Current DeFi protection relies on governance to assess claims.

      * This has major conflict of interest: Gov token owners were often also the underwriters, which incentivises denying claims and avoiding payouts üôÖ
      * Governance also requires manual voting, which scales badly.
    + 2/10 Risk Harbor (RH) replaces human assessors with Smart Contracts which will:

      * 1/ Detect system defaults faster than any governance process.
      * 2/ Eliminate governor incentive to deny claims.
      * 3/ Accommodate rapid scaling.
    + 3/10 Benefits to the whole Terra üåï ecosystem:

      * 1Ô∏è‚É£ $UST: RH will be the buyer of last resort in the event of a de-peg.
      * 2Ô∏è‚É£ [@anchor_protocol](https://twitter.com/anchor_protocol): Protects the competitive, stable yields on $ANC.
      * 3Ô∏è‚É£ [@mirror_protocol](https://twitter.com/mirror_protocol): Shields against flash volatility and oracle manipulation.
    + 4/10 RH Claim Process

      * Instead of getting a simple payout, RH claimants must first transfer the  'distressed / attacked / depegged etc.' tokens to the RH protocol.
      * If the claim is deemed valid, these 'distressed' tokens are swapped for the underwriting tokens held in vaults üí∞
    + 5/10 Initial Deployment

      * RH will begin with protection for Anchor protocol.
      * ~~ Essentially, in the event of a claim, RH users will swap distressed (price-reduced) AnchorUST for UST. ~~
    + 6/10 This RH swapping mechanism is called a Credit Default Swap, which has many advantages:

      * 1Ô∏è‚É£: Prevents manipulation of the RH event detector. Since the 'distressed' token must be produced, no successful claim can be made unless the insured protocol is genuinely hacked. üíÄ
    + 7/10 2Ô∏è‚É£: This also discourages price speculators, who might purchase RH coverage without buying the underlying token, in the hope that the asset's price falls.

      * i.e. Using RH as a put option. üîΩ
    + 8/10 In the future, RH will rely on a central vault which can underwrite a wide range of protocols. The default detector contracts will be stored separately, to ensure greater security.
    + 9/10 The RH Automated Market Maker (AMM) prices the insurance cost by considering factors such as:

      * üëâ Total underwriting capital and premiums paid
      * üëâ Assets to be insured
      * üëâ Claim payouts
    + 10/10 RH Governance &amp; Token

      * RH token will launch after v1 of the protocol is launched.
      * Gov token holders will make macro decisions such as:
      * Adjusting risk parameters
      * Creating vaults
      * Adjusting protocol fees
      * As mentioned, gov tokens holders do not assess claims!
    + üßµ This topic of crypto / DeFi risk management &amp; insurance is of particular interest to me, and I would love to discuss this further with anyone.

      * Here's a 10-tweet summary of the article.
      * A [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) thread.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 1/10

      * Various interactions between people give rise to an emergent coherent whole. Incentive structures and game theoretic constraints gives this whole a distinct nature.
      * Moloch is one such entity.
      * Moloch is the thing that makes people participate in a system they don't want.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 2/10

      * @slatestarcodex gives several concrete examples for Moloch.
      * Prisoner's Dilemma
      * Malthusian trap
      * Dollar auctions
      * Arms races
      * etc.
      * Basically, any dystopia where participants hate the system but nevertheless continue propagating it is an instantiation of Moloch.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 3/10

      * Basic driver:
      * In some competition optimizing for X, there'll be opportunity to throw some other value for improved X. Only those who'll take it will survive. Eventually, everyone‚Äôs relative status will be same as before, but everyone‚Äôs absolute status will be worse.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 4/10

      * "He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power"
      * Understanding the principle will allow us to predict the evolution of social landscape. It also means that we can work on altering the incentive structures.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 5/10

      * There are 4 reasons why our social order isn't ruined by Moloch, yet. However, they may not stay the same.
      * 1/ Excess resources
      * When resources aren't scarce enough to lock us in a war of all against all, people won't take Moloch's offer.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 6/10

      * 2/ Physical limitation
      * It'll prohibit some of Moloch's trades. For eg, you can't starve slaves. If u do, they won't be as much productive.
      * However, technology is making this condition obsolete. Now we have Soylent and modafinil.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 7/10

      * 3/ Utility maximization
      * Many of the utilities these systems optimize for involve human values. Democracy meets citizen values.
      * Propaganda or memes that can spread independent of their truth value is a challenge to this condition. Propaganda helps Moloch coopt democracy.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 8/10

      * Only the 4th reason was said as "good reason" by Scott.
      * 4/ Coordination
      * In the case of Prisoner's dilemma, a Gang leader who'll kill the anyone who defects is a enforcement mechanism for coordination.
      * Technology can seriously improve our coordination capacities.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 9/10

      * @slatestarcodex discusses various approaches to this Moloch problem. In the end, he posits that the solution to this problem is to create another whole that is capable of slaying the Moloch.
    + [@slatestarcodex](https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 10/10

      * "As long as the offer‚Äôs open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him."

    + üßµ An overview in 7 parts, on [@AcrossProtocol](https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol)'s solution for instant transfers from L2 roll-ups to ETH Mainnet.

      * [twitter.com/AcrossProtocol‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol/status/1452645990750695433)
    + 1/7 Problem: To avoid ETH gas fees, optimistic roll-ups ([@arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum) @OptimismPBC) run transactions (txs) off Mainnet, and periodically return lists of txs back to Mainnet.

      * But withdrawals back to Mainnet have a delay of 1 week or more, while the challenge window is finalised.
    + 2/7 Solution: Across uses [@UMAprotocol](https://twitter.com/UMAprotocol)'s Optimistic Oracle with bonded relayers to provide instant txs from L2 back to Mainnet.

      * In essence, relayers provide a short loan to users.
      * Also, liquidity only has to be provided on Mainnet, instead of liquidity on both Mainnet and L2.
    + 3/7 The UMA Oracle üîÆ allows anyone to dispute invalid relays and claim the bond as a reward.

      * Disputes are resolved via secret vote by UMA token holders.
      * For the techies, read more about this fascinating oracle system here: [UMA's Oracle System | UMA Docs](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/oracle)
    + 4/7 For Liquidity Providers (LPers) üí∞, Across only requires them to deposit tokens on Mainnet.

      * LPers then earn fees for each transfer made using the Across Protocol.
    + 5/7 For Depositors (users who wanna move L2 tokens back to Mainnet) üéÅ, they deposit their L2 tokens along with a fee.

      * In return, they instantly receive tokens from the Mainnet Liquidity Pool.
      * Which means skipping the 1-week wait when using the slow native L2 bridge.
    + 6/7 For Relayers üìû to perform an instant relay, they provide upfront money to the Depositor on Mainnet.

      * ~ In essence, the Relayer provides a short-term loan, and is incentivised by a fee. ~
      * The Relayer is then reimbursed from the Liquidity Pool after the challenge period.
    + 7/7 Future developments include effortless cross-chain transfers that bypass Ethereum entirely. ü§Ø

      * Beyond token transfers, other possibilities include:
      * üëâ Cross-chain governance
      * üëâ Cross-chain airdrops

      * A [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) thread.
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 2/10) The 3 main use cases for Polkaswap are:

      * 1/ Swapping tokens
      * 2/ Providing liquidity
      * 3/ Removing liquidity
      * Full entry can be found at: [wiki.sora.org/sora-academy/p‚Ä¶](https://wiki.sora.org/sora-academy/polkaswap)
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 3/10) To practice swapping, using #SORA testnet is recommended.

      * After opening 'swap' page, select the source asset and destination asset from the dropdown. You also need to enter the asset amount. It could be for source asset or destination asset. [pic.twitter.com/vuR6oehCOi](https://twitter.com/yahya_ahd/status/1456276053656231936/photo/1)
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 5/10) The assets from your wallet will be listed by default.

      * If you'd like to add a token that isn't whitelisted, then open the "Custom" tab and enter the asset ID. https://t.co/NASZiKgJAc
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 6/10) Three parameters that should be understood before confirming the swap:

      * 2/ Liquidity provider fee
      * 3/ Network fee
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) Exchange rate on the screen is calculated the moment when you're making the swap. This rate may change before you sign and send the transaction. The transaction will be reverted if the exchange rate changes unfavorably by more than the percentage determined by slippage tolerance.
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 8/10) Liquidity provider fee: This is a fee that will be distributed among accounts who have a share in the liquidity pool.

      * Network fee:  This is a fee for transaction in the network (gas).
    + [@sora_xor](https://twitter.com/sora_xor) [@polkaswap](https://twitter.com/polkaswap) [@scribeDAO](https://twitter.com/scribeDAO) 9/10) Click "Swap" once you are ready.

      * It's a public ledger where everyone can see all transactions
      * There's a huge amount of accountants verifying transactions
      * Smart contracts that don't require human interaction can be added
    + 4/9 How do I interact with the blockchain?

      * Keep your keys (i.e. seed phrase) and signature private
      * A transaction can't be carried out if your haven't signed it
      * Your wallet will provide a public address to interact with other wallets
    + 5/9 What's decentralized finance (DeFi)?

      * Most important activities are swapping, pooling, and NFT trading
      * Swapping: you buy tokens using a base token of your choice (as you would trade one currency for another on a forex exchange) [pic.twitter.com/HGPEV98UsR](https://twitter.com/0xandreharrison/status/1456275187658227713/photo/1)

    + A thread  on Why Parallel

      * Original article [Why Parallel?](https://medium.com/@Fitchinverse/why-parallel-1f939f5aa714)
      * A summary for @scribeDao
    + &gt; Parallel is Sci-FI gaming platform which leverages NFT technology

      * &gt;The game consists of trading card which are battles against other opponent/s
      * &gt;There are five parallel factions :
      * 1:Marcolian
      * 2:Shroud
      * 3:Earthen
      * 4:Augencore
      * 5:Kathari
    + &gt;BackStory is that a cataclysm occurs on earth around the need to create a sustainable energy

      * &gt;Those on earth divides into 5 group and 4 of them boards different ships and flees to different destinations with one group left behind
    + &gt;Overtime these group's evolve distinctly from each other

      * &gt;The success of parallel will depend on both extrinsic factors such as (landscape and competition ) as well as intrinsic factors (Decisions made by the parallel team and community)
    + CCG, a genre ripe for disruption?

      * &gt;Compared to other genres CCG are less immersive and immediately appealing
      * &gt;There are very few standouts in CCG genres
      * eg:Pokemon, Gathering , Hearthstone
      * &gt;But CCG teach important skills such as verbal skills,Group interaction etc
    + &gt;According to GrandView Research "Rising casino culture is expected to drive the adoption of playing cards to win cash"

      * &gt;Overtime CCG has become more modern and digital but still it doesn't match the immediate impressiveness of other genres
    + &gt;There is also not much diversity in the themes of CCG games

      * &gt;It is clear that there is enough room for improvement in CCG genre games
    + Reasons why parallel might succeed

      * 1: ART
      * &gt;Art is really important for a card game,its the first thing we notice when we start playing
      * &gt;Parallel has really impressive art
      * 2:Lore:
      * &gt;Lore is what binds us to the game , it is critical
    + &gt;Parallel diverges from other CCG by opting a SciFi theme

      * &gt;It is driven by 5 parallel and the quest to return by home and to find the perfect source of energy
      * &gt;It offers a future and modern looking appearance to the users
    + &gt;They are also considering various forms of media such as comics and films around the franchise
    + Unique Mechanics:

      * &gt;Parallel will offer a mix of digital and physical collectible card merged by an AR/Metaverse layer
      * &gt;Paragons are the  leaders for each parallel. In the game paragons act as playable characters for each race
    + &gt;Paradox is voting system that allows members of the parallel to steer the direction of the ecosystem

      * &gt;Cards can be deployed face down into bank to generate power , This will add a unique dimension to the game play
      * Resources By The Numbers.
    + &gt;Parallel recently raised 50 million dollars at a valuation of 500 million dollars

      * &gt;There are about 25k unique card holders
      * &gt;Parallel initial sale netted over 2 million dollars, subsequent sales will net them around 4-5 million each time
    + &gt;Parallel has generated roughly 15 million from secondary sales , this number will likely rise in future

      * &gt;Estimates suggest Parallel team will have approximately 100 million USD in deployable capital by the end of 2021

      * TLDR: XOR is designed by #SORA specifically for use as a currency in any country, perfect to power the metaverse and be scaled up to serve as an¬†InterPlanetary Economic System (IPES)

      * Article: [Many Worlds. One Economy.](https://medium.com/sora-xor/many-worlds-one-economy-1ce709d4fb42)
      * Currencies throughout history relied on trust to a centralised entity such as the government or central bank.  When the system is overly centralised without democratic oversight, the economy can suffer.
    + 3/8 Case of El Salvador

      * The acceptance of Bitcoin is a step in the right direction. However, the economic structure does not benefit directly from adding Bitcoin as a legal tender, because of its price volatility and no correlation with the economic needs of the country.

      * Tackle slow block times and high fees. Thanks to the SORA Token Bonding Curve, a transaction on XOR costs only cents and takes up to 3 secs to complete on average (costs a few dollars and &gt;15mins on the Bitcoin Network).

    + üßµ A @ScribeDAO thread. We summarise interesting articles for you.

      * "Narrative Distillation" by [@kevinakwok](https://twitter.com/kevinakwok)
      * [Narrative Distillation - kwokchain](https://kwokchain.com/2021/09/29/narrative-distillation-1)
      * Stepping back from crypto, here's a broader look at the role of narrative and CEOs in tech companies today.
    + 1/11: The traditional role of investment banks (IBs) in debuting companies to investors is shrinking.

      * Companies are far more known to the public, and IBs provide less clout to their IPO process.
      * The better alternative: Direct communication of their narrative to investors.
    + 2/11: Tech companies now enter the public market with huge revenue multiples (2x to 2000x).

      * With these large ranges, and easy access to capital, what turns an 'alright' IPO into 'amazing' is the ability of the founder to capture public belief in a company's future potential.
    + 3/11: Fundraising and IPOs are natural points for a company to step back, think hard about their multi-year plan, and shape their narrative.

      * In the volatile and unpredictable world of tech, narrative carries power in contextualising the snapshot of a company's performance.
    + 4/11: A strong founder-led narrative also inspires confidence in:

      * a. Future success;
      * b. Future revenue;
      * c. Ability to become multi-product/platform; and
      * d. Compounding loops (network effects, economies of scale etc.)
    + 5/11: Self-fulfilling prophecies - the analogy of PE ratios to narrative leverage.

      * High PE allows companies to raise capital from future promises.
      * Deploying that capital realises those dreamy aspirations.
      * Thus the magical flourish ~ creating something from nothing.
    + 6/11: Top companies - especially their founders - are now rising out of the shadow of VC firms.

      * Founders are growing their brand, while venture is relatively stagnating. Founders can also uniquely refine their narrative to best resonate with investors, hires,or customers.
    + 7/11 - At present, any external advantages (discoveries, novel markets) are rapidly eroded by competition.

      * Companies must rely on internal compounding advantages - such as narrative - to thrive.
      * E.g. Adobe has shapeshifted from print software to SaaS, cloud infra and others.
    + 8/11 - Narrative leverage sustains the scarcest resource - company talent.

      * Employee excitement drives quality product creation, which invariably results in customer confidence.
      * Most importantly, it allows employees to see where they fit in the company's larger strategy.
    + 9/11: The top CEOs prioritise narrative distillation.

      * E.g. #1: [@patrickc](https://twitter.com/patrickc) &amp; [@collision](https://twitter.com/collision) excelled at creating Stripe's narrative of developer-first, engineer-driven payment systems. They were thus able to attract and build teams which would have otherwise dismissed them.
    + 10/11: E.g. #2: [@tobi](https://twitter.com/tobi) and by extension @shopify have strongly signalled their priority of developing their founder's brand - by hanging out in Clubhouse, AMAs, streams and more.

      * E.g. #3: [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) being Elon.
    + 11/11 Conclusion - Narrative allows companies to pull forward resources into the present, to make future devts ~inevitable~.

      * Investors, employees and consumers seek the coherence and clarity that narrative provides.
      * Today, the founder is responsible for distilling narrative.
    + üßµ Personal thoughts ~ I wonder if we're giving too little credit to people's ability to look beyond narrative / hype / branding when choosing to support a company. Still, a thoroughly informative and immersive read.

      * TL:DR; RomeDAO is expanding the Olympus ecosystem onto the Kusama and Polkadot chains with a fresh perspective on how to carry out the Ohmie mission
      * NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE [pic.twitter.com/ogB0CzENwr](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775714242809866/photo/1)
    + üÖ∞Ô∏èWhy Kusama/Polkadot?

      * Moonriver is EVM-compatible with significant liquidity that Romans can leverage to be seen as the premier stable asset within the ecosystem
      * Their unique value props are out of scope for this thread, but lead to them being primed for exponential growth [pic.twitter.com/1IJJ60kRfK](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775722648137728/photo/1)
    + 1‚É£ Mechanism design

      * Following OHM in its goal to create a healthy POL based reserve currency RomeDAO is offering 3 different bonds with FRAX, MIM, and MOVR as an initial means of bootstrapping
      * There's a potential partnership with [@AnyswapNetwork](https://twitter.com/AnyswapNetwork)  to bridge assets to MOVR
    + 2‚É£ Tokenomics

      * Rome will have 100% of tokens be allocated to the community, meaning founding members of the DAO are also buying into the DAO at the same time as you
      * This means no VC funding, and a truly fair token allocation to all who want to participate
    + 2‚É£ con

      * How will the DAO get funds to operate if they won't be raising?
      * To support contributors and devs, the DAO will be levying an initial 10% tax on all bonds for 2 months, and then will reduce that tax to ~5% (or whatever seems necessary) for future capital
    + 3‚É£ Treasury direction

      * Rome willl have treasury directors (from the team) dictating how the treasury of assets are deployed, but will eventually onboard a community governance process
      * Treasury will be deployed to grow reserves and also support new project growth on MOVR/DOT
    + 4‚É£ Smart Contracts

      * Rome SCs were basically the audited OHM contracts, but now that they've been adapted for MOVR they've become unaudited, so continue at your own risk
    + 5‚É£ Community/Growth/Whitelisting

      * Whitelisting process is TBA, look for it closer to launch date
      * Community/Growth perspectives are interesting
      * To build a community that has a gamified incentive to learn/contribute ROME is introducing Roman war campaigns as a roadmap [pic.twitter.com/MVon5vZ3CQ](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775738188034054/photo/1)
    + 5‚É£ con

      * Campaigns are spearheaded by the Senate (core/team) roles, with Governors voted in by the community
      * Territories (verticals, channels, partnerships) are development goals fought for through campaigns and managed by Governors [pic.twitter.com/pCHHXLoHQS](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775743481286656/photo/1)
    + 5‚É£ con

      * Completing objectives/goals on the way to capture territories leads community participants to earn spoils of war (NFTs) which are included in a participants metaverse trophy room and upgrades the community members avatar with new equipment
      * Then the next campaign starts [pic.twitter.com/TQnkIB8qrq](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775747944054784/photo/1)
    + 6‚É£ Ancillary thoughts

      * [@romedaofinance](https://twitter.com/romedaofinance)  reminds me quite a bit of [@templedao](https://twitter.com/templedao)
      * They're pursuing a launch process which I would classify as extremely fair to all potential participants
      * They're focused on building a community that truly follows the (3,3) ideology
    + 6‚É£ con

      * To that end there is NO VC funding, and even the founding members are buying tokens like us through the bonding process
      * They've created a unique incentive for community participation through gamification, and have eloquently combined the metaverse into a protocol
    + 6‚É£ con

      * Their community is already bustling and growing, and they've brought on an amazing team compromised of both early members of OlympusDAO and some key policy designers
      * They've even acquired a UX specialist to really enrich the community interaction with the DAO dAPP [pic.twitter.com/JfPlunLuok](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775756349370371/photo/1)
    + 6‚É£ Conclusion

      * Community tends to be the only true moat for emerging DeFi protocols as one can always fork code
      * Rome's potential is seen with OHM, but their significant focus on community will be a true differentiator that enables them to be a mainstay on the DOT/MOVR ecosytems [pic.twitter.com/DAEalNaIUy](https://twitter.com/GoolagCrypto/status/1455775764461146125/photo/1)
