# Full Text:

Messari is hiring for various positions, including full-time analysts and a few select community analysts.

In the past, I’ve provided advice to strangers and friends who are looking to get a full-time job in crypto. I’ve previously [written](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/breaking-into-blockchain-how-i-got-full-time-job-at-consensys/) about this before at length, but it’s been a few years and I wanted to update my advice with some more recent examples and new thoughts.

## The Quick Version: How I Got a Job in Crypto

I started my career at a small cryptocurrency exchange as an intern where I fell in love with crypto. While working there I notice Ryan Selkis call – “[The Apprentice: Crypto](https://medium.com/@twobitidiot/the-apprentice-crypto-b74b2e0120f7)”  – for volunteer analysts.

In his essay, TBI presented an opportunity – help build out Messari’s open-source library of assets, publish some content, and potentially get a full-time job at Messari. He also promised to be a marginally nicer boss than Donald J. Trump.

As part of the call, analysts had to pitch a token and explain the rationale for why it would be valuable. Having followed Ryan on Twitter, I took a different approach and argued that while some crypto assets will fundamentally change the world – most cryptoassets were overpriced nonsense. I also promise to be a marginally better apprentice than Anakin Skywalker.

“Mason - This is a great email. One of the best we've received.”

Boom. My email was 231 words and contained one gif. After writing a few asset profiles, while I continued working for the exchange, I eventually leveraged Messari’s name and my experience into a job working at ConsenSys. Almost exactly two years later – 6 days off – I interviewed with Messari and joined as Research Analyst. Small world.

Anyway..now that you’ve heard my story, I’d like to share some advice that I believe can help you find a job in the wonderful world of crypto.

## Some Words of Advice

There are only two types of advice: the advice someone passes on because it worked for them, or the humbled and ever-present advice learned from regret. Both are valuable, but you should only replicate the former.

My advice stems from both what worked for me and the things I didn’t do. While applicable to many people, my advice is directed towards individuals with little work experience, current university students, or those with a few years under their belt looking to make a career change.

Think of this advice like a menu, pick and choose a couple of options that sound appetizing to you and commit to them. Consistency matters.

## Become an Intern

Interning is the fastest way to find out if you like a field. If you’re a student at any level and have the chance to become an intern I highly recommend it. This is perhaps the best option for students looking to learn about cryptonetworks and get some experience. While doing my MBA, interning for a local cryptocurrency exchange in Hong Kong was a great initial experience to get my feet wet and become immersed in the crypto space.

## Volunteer or Find a Mentor

Volunteering can be a great way to get some experience, build your resume, and create connections in the crypto world. I volunteered with Messari by writing cryptoasset profiles. Ryan Selkis’ initial [call for analysts](https://medium.com/@twobitidiot/the-apprentice-crypto-b74b2e0120f7) was exactly what I was looking for, a place to get started, to jump in and learn as much as possible. I learned directly about ERC20 tokens, layer 2 state channels,  and more by writing cryptoasset profiles, as well as indirectly through osmosis. When you’re around exceptional people – such as a mentor – their knowledge and experience flows from them to everyone else. The closer you are to exceptional people, the more you learn. You should optimize for this effect in your early career.

Personally speaking, Messari was a significant benefit to my career early on, not only in experience, but also in terms of stature. In the ‘real’ business world, people listen when your resume has an Ivy League school or reads McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, or [insert your favorite big-name company]. It may be unfortunate, but humans have a desire to assign status.

Messari, ConsenSys, <span class="roam-page">[Multicoin Capital](docs/content/multicoin-capital)</span>, Bitmex, <span class="roam-page">[Pantera Capital](docs/content/pantera-capital)</span>, Binance, and Coinbase are some of the most well-known firms in crypto.

More anecdotally, I’ve seen many volunteers from Messari move full time into crypto all because when given a more substantial platform – the Messari community – [they used it as leverage](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106893265920000) to get themselves noticed by the right people.

Messari, at least in part, helped take many careers in blockchain from 0 to 1, which is always the toughest step in any development.

## Write

Nic Carter, Chris Burniske, Derek Hsue, Phil Bonello, Tony Sheng, and Kyle Samani all became names in crypto because they started writing blogs about blockchain topics, mostly related to investment or research. One of the highest skills you can leverage is your ability to write. It’s hard not only to write good content, but to have the guts to put your opinions out there. That being said, anyone can be a writer—never tell yourself otherwise. I never thought of myself as a writer either.

Some easy pieces or forms of writing:

* If you don’t feel comfortable sharing your thoughts, get over it! If you really want to ease into it, start by summarizing great, long, or complex pieces. You’d be surprised by how little time people spend reading. Curated content is important and valuable.
* Domain expertise pieces: examine concepts in a specific domain. [Liquidity mining](https://messari.io/article/q2-20-review-liquidity-mining-drives-defi-usage-and-token-prices-to-all-time-highs). [NFTs](https://messari.io/article/opensea-surpasses-20-000-users-unofficially-claims-the-title-the-uniswap-of-nfts). [Smart contracts](https://messari.io/article/q2-20-review-platform-wars-narrative-poised-for-a-comeback). [Stablecoins](https://messari.io/article/q2-20-review-stablecoins-at-the-heart-of-defi-boom). [Digital Art](https://messari.io/article/the-cure-for-starving-artists-nft-royalty-fees). [DeFi aggregation](https://messari.io/article/value-capture-in-the-age-of-defi-aggregation).

## Tweet

If you don’t like prose, Twitter is here for you. CryptoTwitter values those who participate or ask relevant questions. Some of the brightest people in crypto use Twitter to build their brands like Pomp, Ryan Sean Adams, Meltem Dimirros, Arianna Simpson Nic Carter, Ari David Paul, Hasu, Tom Shaughnessy, Jason Choi, and many more. Just don’t be a troll.

## Leverage Social Media

While Twitter has a strong crypto community, you can find your preferred medium using Instagram, Reddit, Periscope, TikTok (RIP), Telegram, or other social media networks. Most people can only be successful at a few mediums like Twitter and Linkedin or Instagram and Tik Tok so use whichever feels most authentic.

Answer questions on Quora, it’ll help you understand crypto and garner views or increase your brand. If you answer enough questions, well then you have a written piece.

## Join meetups, events, and clubs

If you’re in a locale teeming with blockchain activity, I recommend going to meetups or community events, most of which are free. Some common places to find events include [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) and [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/ethereum/). For university students, check out your school’s blockchain club or start your own! I don’t recommend conferences if you’re looking for a job, as conference tickets don’t give a good ROI unless you’re incredible at networking (let’s face it you’d probably be employed if you were).

## Move to a crypto city

By nature, we are all products of our environment. It’s no secret that if you want to be successful in tech, you should probably live where innovation is happening. I’m not saying you need to move to a major tech city like New York or San Francisco, but you should take advantage of it if you live there. Other up-and-coming tech cities in the U.S include Los Angeles, Denver, Austin, Dallas, and Seattle. If you’re willing to venture abroad, you have even more options. Paris, Shanghai, or Singapore would all be great places to move to and give you an edge. Also, I hear Berlin’s beautiful in the summer.

I will caveat this by saying where you live is becoming less important. There are many blockchain companies that are now remote-first including Coinbase and ConsenSys.

## Leverage your strengths (wizard abilities)

Those with some working experience should utilize it. If you have any skills including:

* Analyst (excel wizard)
* CPA (accounting wizard)
* CFA (“I do not give investment advice” wizard)
* Lawyer (never get bored of case law wizard)
* Fearless public speaker (sound or podcast wizard)
* Write like Dickens (keyboard wizard)
* People Wizard (companies literally pay for networks, it’s just called Business Development)
* Process (detail-oriented and operational wizard)
* Design (Photoshop and graphic design wizard)
* Economics knowledge (crypto is underpinned by incentive mechanisms and game theory)

If you have any of these skills, then you possess an advantage over many others currently in crypto. For the students and youngsters out there, leverage your time to learn new skills or gain experience.

## Offer Your Help and Assistance

This doesn’t mean telling someone “please let me know how I can be helpful” as if you’re a VC or [parody VC account](https://twitter.com/vcstarterkit). The crypto world is small compared to any other industry. You can reach out to people on Twitter and to a lesser extent email. Don’t reach out to the manager of a VC firm or CEO of your favorite crypto company. They likely won’t respond. Find someone newer to the firm as they likely have more time and will relate to you as a young professional. There are a [bunch of articles](https://www.themuse.com/tags/networking) about how to reach out to people, so I won’t say much, other than you should find a way to offer value.

Some examples:

* People are always searching for things, help them find the information they need.
* Curation of content, news, information, data, people, educational materials, etc.
* Start a local network in your community
* Think outside the box – people aren’t always able to tell you what they want/need. What can your unique set of skills and traits offer?

## Start a YouTube Channel or Podcast

Perhaps you’re not a wordsmith, but you excel at making videos, especially live content. Start your own Youtube channel or make some tutorial videos. YouTube is the second largest search engine – leverage it.

Podcasting is primed for crypto discussion. Jill Carlson and Meltem Demirors have a great podcast. Tony Sheng experimented with a fun podcast (still waiting for the next season). What Bitcoin Did by Peter McCormack. Nathaniel Whittemore started [Long Reads Sunday](https://t.co/RDuINI6IXi?amp=1) which curated content and now hosts a successful podcast/Livestream.

Podcast advice:

* For the love of God, don’t just think that a podcast means an interview with x person.
* Consider live-streaming podcasts for greater authenticity
* Make your podcasts a story (Crazy Genius), educational (Gimlet), or something different.
* See Robinhood [Snack’s Podcast](https://snacks.robinhood.com/) which does small daily news pieces or Naval and Nivi’s podcast from [Spearhead](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/spearhead-naval-xWVg_YRt-0w/) or [How to Get Rich](https://nav.al/how-to-get-rich).
* There’s room for small –3 to 15 min – podcast snippets. Just because Joe Rogan perfected the 2-hour podcast doesn’t mean every podcast needs to be at least an hour.

## Reddit

If you don’t feel comfortable tweeting, writing medium posts, or reaching out – get comfortable with it, seriously.

However, if you’re new to crypto and afraid of Cunningham’s Law, ask questions on Reddit and participate in discussions. Now that Reddit’s releasing community points, participating could result in a financial return. Proving you’re a valued member of a reddit community that uses an Ethereum token is basically 40% of the work in crypto networks.

## Find a crypto buddy

ETH has friends and so should you. Find a friend that is just as passionate as you are and work with each other on any of the above topics. Nobody makes it to the top alone. Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman are a well-oil content machine. [Hasu](https://twitter.com/hasufl?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – arguably one of the best researchers in crypto – writes with other individuals quite often.

## How to Find a Job

There are two ways to find a job. The easy way and the hard way.

### The Easy Way

Be a human and go network. In all sincerity, networking is the best way to find a job. Putting in the effort to reach out, go to networking events, or communicate online will help you more than you know. At the end of the day, people want to work with their friends.

### The Hard Way

The best piece of advice I can offer: you need to stand out and target your audience. The quality of your application is more important than the quantity of applications you send.

Sending the same cover letter or application to 100 jobs may get you a job, but if there are only a handful of companies you really want to work at, you need to put in the effort to get that job.

My last piece of advice for crafting your application – badass people are different, so think differently. Here are just a few ideas:

* Create a [graphic](https://www.canva.com/), [chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/users/login#docs?folder_id=home&browser=icon&sort=saved-desc), or video to express something visually.
* Think of a cool project ([stablecoinindex](https://stablecoinindex.com/)) and do something slightly different ([#defi index](https://defiprime.com/), [DeepDAO](http://deepdao.world/#/deepdao/dashboard)
* Get ahead of a growing trend like [personal tokens](https://forefront.news/market/).
* Make a website or newsletter that provides something valuable, such as a list of meeting times for every open-source crypto project. Find a way to save someone time or effort – that’s value-added.
* Research a super niche topic that relates to blockchain and write/tweet about your findings. It shouldn’t be superficial, but it doesn’t have to be completely revolutionary, just tweet/write/speak your version and opinions.

Employers value people who act on their own and produce cool shit.

If you’re still a student or only a year or two out of school, consider yourself lucky. You most likely have fewer commitments and plenty of time on your hands – or time you can spend more efficiently – to build your brand and follow the above suggestions.

## A Note About Your Resume

Again, make your resume specific. If you’re totally lost on how to craft your resume or want to start from scratch, [Harvard](https://ocs.fas.harvard.edu/resumes-cvs-cover-letters) offers a lot of free material. Also, [get creative](https://blog.enhancv.com/the-23-most-creative-resume-designs-weve-seen/) on your resume or at least [add some aesthetically pleasing template](https://www.canva.com/templates/resumes/). Remember, you’re dealing with humans – with [lizard brains](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/rbtvz/eli12_lizard_brain_vs_primate_brain/) – who are naturally drawn to bright colors, graphics, and pictures. Lastly, use data and metrics when possible, even if it’s just showing your month-over-month social media growth, reddit karma points, or views to your blog posts.

These are some great resources to find a job:

* [Messari](https://messari.io/careers) – We are hiring
* [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs#find/f!%7B%22types%22%3A%5B%22full-time%22%5D%2C%22keywords%22%3A%5B%22crypto%22%2C%22blockchain%22%5D%7D) – one of the best places to find a job in crypto, hands down.
* [Crypto Jobs](https://crypto.jobs/) – Also has a visually friendly list to find jobs.
* [CryptoJobsList](https://cryptojobslist.com/) - a great site for jobs.
* [Cryptocurrency jobs](https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/) – Another one.
* [Proof of Talent Job Board](https://proofoftalent.co/careers/) – For the more senior/technical
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) – finding crypto and blockchain jobs on LinkedIn is becoming more normal.
* [Proof of Work common application](http://proofofworkcommonapp.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/) – yup, it’s like college all over again.
* Newsletters – follow the newsletters of your favorite companies and they’ll often announce new positions or opportunities.
* Most VCs post job openings for their portfolio companies: [Pantera](https://jobs.panteracapital.com/). [ConsenSys Labs](https://careers.labs.consensys.net/).

## Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

You will feel like you are not qualified. Apply.

You will be afraid to tweet or post thoughts publicly. Do it anyway.

You will be wrong. That’s okay, your opinions are allowed to change.

Apply.

## Final Thoughts

Work hard, stay humble, and live happily.

Lastly, I’d like to thank Messari for giving me the opportunity to work in a field I love, surrounded by incredible individuals. Also, thank you Crypto Twitter, most of you are awesome.
